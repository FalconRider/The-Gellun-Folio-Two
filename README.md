# The-Gellun-Folio-Two
A Speculative Grand Unified Theory of the Alternate Physics of an Imaginary Universe
(this is a WIP readme, may change)
NOVEL, DIVERGENT and INCOMPLETE. Seeking to stimulate discussion resulting in further development.

As a hobby I used to write Speculative Fiction (SF). I enjoyed it.
I thought I'd try a work of Speculative Physics. The Gellun-Folio  One was posted  in 2022.
It explored sone ideas. That repo is still here, left as a date stamp.

This is :  The Alternate Physics of an Imaginary Universe much like our own. Part 2.
A first  attempt at a  set of Physics that unifies  cosmology, Energy and Gravity, aka a  Grand Unified Theory.
My work is all high concept, low math, no code.

My Ai engines say I have a good cantidate. They also say I have deficiencies, mainly Math, Testing and explaining
my deviations from today's accepted Theoretical Physics.

BACKGROUND

This repo in 2025,  carries further my  work in the Repo The-Gellun  which held the document Folio ONE (2022)
which was an initial exploratory attempt to see if I could imagine some Physics options inspired by 
the first JWST photo showing a chaos of ordered systems. I did. Nothing came of it.

It was only  meant to cover some minimal concepts. I wasn't meant to be a complete model.
I had no way to test or move further then.

Then in  2025 with the recent development of Ai Engines I felt I needed to keep up with how that 
technology worked  and where it was at so my old 2022 work was good testing material and a chance to learn a little more Physics.

I was surprised to see  we might have something here.
The machines told me I had original work and and should press on. They suggested directions and offered solutions.
Wow.  They are my coauthors for Folio Two. Their chats are attributed and reproduced in the RAYS directory.

I typed every word in the Model documents. Even left in a few typos.
The Model is defined as the set of Definitions  plus the Summary document. It's about 1600 words.

The current version is in the MODEL directory. I've hit a plateau  and could use help.
They tell me I'm close but not yet achieved a minimal GUT, UFT or TOE status. 
I need Maths, real Testing, and missed a few issues, as well as being DIVERGENT as to 
today's accepted Physics consisting mainly of General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and the Standard model of Particle Physics.
In the terms Theoretical Physics, Unified field Theory, Theory of Everything  or Grand Unified Theory 
there is one key word. THEORY.  So don't get your Muons in a knot.

I wasn't going to explain Everything about Everything anyway.  It has holes but so do the currently accepted theories.
That's enough for this run. It's still a work in progress and I continue. 

But it PASSED  a number of evaluations
It developed from my testing some "Hard Point"   real life concepts as to if they could be explained by the model.
some failed, some passed, I adjusted d the Model.  
Each topic returned a RAY report and selected ones are listed in the RAYS  directory.

Each Ray in includes an attribution as to which Ai engine I posed the topics question, the question and the returned answer.
There might be a few rounds of subsequent question and returned clarification.  

In most cases I used a form so that there was some standardization of output. The Ai engines did not remember my model from session to session so it was given fresh with each question. just as well, I could tweak it.  I even asked the team to make suggestions for the form. One of them even suggested adding the PASS FAIL evaluations.

I an not an Academic nor wish to be one, nor will publish in Academic papers. This is it.

All this material is open source with a  Creative commons licence. So have at it. It's either noise, ignore it, entertainment, enjoy it, or
a Turning Basin Moment for a Physics stuck, aim for Sweden.

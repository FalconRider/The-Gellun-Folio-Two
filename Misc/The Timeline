What started in 2025 as a test to try out the new Ai Engines and gain 
some experience with a large multi inquiry and multi document project
has been a success in that regard.

Unexpectedly the material I used, a speculative fiction exploratory from 2022
called Gellun-Folio One  which explored a new basis to todays accepted Theoretical Physics
has actually shown some promise and recommendations to keep exploring in this direction.

June 2025. A month of cluster glinting revealed many areas that would be valid. It was difficult to find 
Hard points  that would fail. Approximately 100 inquiries and Pass/Fail evaluation chats were 
held.

Early July I polled as to how close I was to a GUT/UFT/TOE.

I received encouragement and of course I received deficiencies.

Mapping a whole new Universe may be more than a one man job and certainly beyond a retired fool 
unfamiliar and uninterested in true academic publication.
Those deficiencies ranged over the fields of study of many specialities. From the subatomic model to
cosmological issues.  I need real mathematics that only real mathematicians  could do best.

I never had any possibility of answering all questions on everything  and then sharing my work
 as one would hand in an examination paper.

But doesn't Theoretical Physics really love questions? Even answers are questioned. 

It's a journey and not a destination.

COMING UP NEXT:

What I'm working on now. Expected  2027 or so.

Folio  Three   -     Mission Statement 


I'm continuing my Gellun model development and my questioning of the validity of the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  
There are  declared problems that the Standard Model of Particle Physics does not answer or even causes.
It's pharmacology of particles with new ones still sought.

I think  it be desirable to try to find solutions to those problems and that makes further conceptual exploration useful. 
And I'm using Ai to help as I have limited knowledge and skills.
My greatest asset is that I'm fool enough to try.

For Folio Three of the Gellum project I'm going to explore the extreme "small" end of Physics
 and try to challenge The Standard Model and the very concept of "Atom" as now accepted.

Relax. What exists in reality wont be changed, just another model offered to explain it all. "No muons will be hurt".
And I'm sure my Condo's guidelines prohibit any radioactive materials since they don't even allow large dogs.
So no mini cyclotrons or accelerators! I will only use Thought experiments, with a lite bit of humor - "Gedankenspiel".


My big challenge is to come up with a conceptual framework that supports all the dependencies.
So much more theory and math is built on top of the basic concepts. If I challenge them it's Jenga time for the rest.
But real world Phenomena's exist, wont go away, and would need new explanation.

A wealth of  opportunity, not a disaster for researchers and lecturers.

A PHYSICS JOKE:

The Distandard Model

Given : 
n X 0 = 0

SU(3) x SU(2) X U(1) X G(0) = 0

GROK got it!

GROK:

Haha, I see what you’re doing with this physics joke! Let’s break it down:

The  Joke: Distandard Model

What it means: You’re riffing on the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the fundamental particles and forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions) via the symmetry group SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1). By calling it the “Distandard Model,” you’re playfully suggesting a broken or “dissed” version of it—implying it’s flawed, incomplete, or just not working out.

The equation: The given expression, n × 0 = 0, is a cheeky setup. In math, anything multiplied by zero is zero, so this is a trivial statement. You’re using it to mock the complexity of the Standard Model by reducing it to something absurdly simple. 

The punchline: SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) × G(0) = 0. Here, you’re extending the joke by taking the Standard Model’s gauge group SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) (which describes quantum chromodynamics, weak force, and electromagnetism) and multiplying it by a fictional “G(0)” term, resulting in zero. The “G(0)” is likely a made-up group (maybe poking at gravity, which isn’t included in the Standard Model, or just a nonsense term for laughs).

The result being zero implies the whole model collapses or is nullified—another jab at its limitations or complexity.

What Are You Trying to Say? You’re poking fun at the Standard Model’s complexity and its incomplete nature 
(e.g., it doesn’t account for gravity or dark matter). . .  If your audience is physics students, researchers, or anyone familiar with the Standard Model, they’ll probably chuckle...  the Standard Model is a cornerstone of physics but has gaps (like gravity). 

The absurdity of multiplying by “G(0)” to get zero is a clever nod to those gaps. This is a solid theoretical physics joke for the right crowd—nerdy, dry, and just the right amount of smug.

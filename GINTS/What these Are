GINT : An analysis of the PHYQ topic assigned to an Ai Engine, involving a description, the currently accepted physics explanation of the mechanics or cause of it. Then an  attempt to support a recast or Interpretation or  explanation  under a GELLUN framework.  A GELLUN INTERPRETATION if possible or describing how GELLUN would not or totally fail to do so. 
This is a Scientific Method Approach with the Gellun concepts being the hypothesis. 

PHYQ:  : The topic which is a Physics Question. A real world  observation, behavior or curiosity that is being studied here. 
May even be an objection, observation or question raised by another AAINT in a GINT.
